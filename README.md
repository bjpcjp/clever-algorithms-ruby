* Code is simply copied into Notebook cells. No optimization or refactoring has been attempted thus far, except for commenting out the interim output status messages. (This will be improved in the future.)

* Jupyter Notebook format, using Ruby 2.2.5. 1-2 kernel crashes have been seen during code execution, which requires investigation. At least one segmentation fault is noted.

* Next steps:
	- Commenting code
	- Adding pseudocode & explanatory notes for each algorithm
	- Refactoring if needed
	- Adding resource links
	- Adding test assertions
	- Converting code into classes/methods
